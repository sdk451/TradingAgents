Okay, based on the provided analysis and proposed investment plan, I agree with the assessment. The mixed signals and high valuation of TSLA, coupled with execution risks and increasing competition, make a directional bet too risky at this time. A cautious "Hold" with strict monitoring and clearly defined triggers is the most prudent approach.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
