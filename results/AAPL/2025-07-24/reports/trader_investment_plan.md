Based on the detailed analysis, particularly the significant regulatory threats to Apple's services segment and the premium valuation unjustified by future growth, I recommend selling AAPL. The phased divestment strategy and reallocation of capital to opportunities with clearer growth and better risk-reward profiles are sound.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
