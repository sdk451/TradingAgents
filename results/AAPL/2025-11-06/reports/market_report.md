### Market Context
Current market conditions present an intriguing dichotomy. On one hand, the upward trends indicated by moving averages and MACD suggest that AAPL is in a strong bullish phase primarily after the recent dip. Conversely, the high RSI points towards an overbought condition that typically precedes short-term pullbacks. Therefore, traders should consider balancing their positions and assessing entry and exit strategies carefully.
